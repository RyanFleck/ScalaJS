# ScalaJS Test Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RyanFleck/ScalaJS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RyanFleck/ScalaJS)

A small repository partially following the [basic ScalaJS tutorial](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/tutorial/basic/)
showcasing how to compile Scala code for the web. I'm writing this because I'm
interested in edge computing and would prefer for computation to be outsourced
to client devices to lower server costs.


**Completed Goals:**

1. Write some Scala
1. Compile to JavaScript
1. Manipulate DOM
1. Write tests to verify DOM was manipulated


**ToDo:**

1. Create a simple REPL
1. Send an XMLHTTPRequest to get some data
1. Process the contents of a file
1. Process the contents of a textarea
